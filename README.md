# Beacon Detector...


BeaconDetector is an application that detects and displays information about iBeacons in the surrounding area. iBeacons are small, low-power devices that transmit a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal that can be picked up by nearby devices such as smartphones. The BeaconDetector application takes advantage of this capability to detect iBeacons and display information such as their UUID, Major and Minor values, and signal strength.

The application can be used to detect iBeacons in various scenarios such as retail stores, museums, airports, and more. Retailers can use Beacons to provide personalized shopping experiences, while museums can use them to provide location-based information to visitors.

To use the BeaconDetector application, the user simply needs to have a device with Bluetooth capabilities and the application installed. The application will then automatically scan for nearby iBeacons and display the information on the screen.

Overall, the BeaconDetector application is a useful tool for anyone who wants to learn more about iBeacons and how they work.
