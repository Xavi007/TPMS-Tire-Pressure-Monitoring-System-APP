# Tire Temperature Pressure Management System App!!

The Tire Temperature Pressure Management System (TTPMS) App is a project that aims to provide real-time monitoring and management of tire temperature and pressure using beacon technology. The app utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons attached to each tire to gather data and presents it in a user-friendly interface for drivers and fleet managers.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of tire temperature and pressure.
- User-friendly dashboard displaying the status of each tire.
- Alerts and notifications for abnormal tire conditions.
- Historical data tracking for performance analysis.
- Fleet management capabilities for commercial applications.

## How to Setup and Run

### Pre-requisites

To set up and run the Tire Temperature Pressure Management System (TTPMS) App project, make sure you have the following:

- Android or iOS device with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support.
- Bluetooth beacons compatible with your device.

1. Download and install the TTPMS App from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
   - The app is available for both Android and iOS devices.

2. Ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on your device.

3. Attach the Bluetooth beacons to each tire in your vehicle.

4. Open the TTPMS App on your device.

5. The app will automatically scan and detect the nearby Bluetooth beacons.

6. Once the beacons are detected, the app will start displaying real-time tire temperature and pressure data on the dashboard.

7. Set up the desired thresholds for tire conditions (e.g., minimum and maximum pressure, temperature limits) to receive alerts and notifications for abnormal tire conditions.
